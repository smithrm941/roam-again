# Roam

Roam is one of my first full-stack web apps created from scratch from a set of specs I was given. This is a web app where users can register individual profiles, log in and log out, and make posts about cities to individual pages about that city. User profiles also include links to any posts a user has made. Users can also visit other users profile pages, but can only edit the information in their own profile.

## Technologies and concepts used:

- Node
- Express
- Express-Session
- Postgres
- ejs
- REST API
- Environment variables
- Promises
- Authentication and authorization
